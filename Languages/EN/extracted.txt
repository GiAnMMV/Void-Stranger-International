Mom!
What is it dear?
Look!
Oh, you actually found one!
It even has five petals.
Hehee...
You didn't just pluck one out, little imp?
No way!
I found it on my own!
I'm just teasing.
When I was little, we used to gather these flowers as mementos to those who passed away.
You should give it to granny.
Okay!
What are you trying to insinuate there?
I'm not that old yet...
Sure sure, old-timer.
Here you go, granny!
I wonder...
Maybe we're simply too late.
All light that reaches us is just a faded memory.
If we wish to escape their fate...
We must shine even brighter.
Our light must become endless.
Become endless?
To hell with all of that!
I'm happy because we're together, right here and now.
Even when the last star burns out...
This memory will surely remain.
Because I love you.
What have we here...
Haven't I seen that face before?
But those eyes...
There's nothing behind them.
Ksi shi shi shi shi shi shi!
I got it!
You're one of those *****horn's useless dolls, aren't you?
I do not remember selling you any of my hot tips.
And unfortunately for you...
I do not take credit!
[A strange character stares at you]
[You hear a voice]
[Who are you?]
[You ponder for a moment, but can't recall]
[Why are you here?]
[I don't know]
[Or have you forgotten?]
[How long has it been since you started your journey...]
[You must be tired]
[Would you like to stay...]
[Forever?]
[...]
[You seem hesitant somehow]
[Because I'm afraid]
[There's nothing left]
[But leaving now somehow feels even scarier]
[Don't worry]
[I'm here with you]
[And I'll be there when you wake up as well]
[A gentle remnant of warmth embraces you]
[Your weariness begins to fade away]
[Your senses grow dull]
[Your grasp of this waking world weakens...]
[Ever so slowly]
[Yet ever...]
[So...]
[Surely...]
That's it.
I give up.
How uncharacteristic of you.
Didn't you find my riddles childish to begin with?
Just tell me the answer already.
My sleep schedule is in shambles...
Is that what you truly desire?
Desire?
We're always looking for answers.
But let's say you were to meet ***.
You could ask them any question and they would give you a definite answer.
Would that satisfy you?
Or would you rather reach your own conclusions?
Hmph.
You know how I feel about that kind of hogwash.
But if this *** were to exist...
I would tell them to shove it and go to hell.
That's the spirit!
I'm also calling bullshit on your riddles.
How about I'll tell you the answer over a drink?
It'll be my treat.
This just might be your worst pick-up attempt so far.
So it's a yes then?
... Don't push your luck, pretty boy.
[A strange being stares vacantly into nothingess]
[It doesn't react to your movements]
[...]
[Is it malfunctioning?]
...
Add...
Long time ago...
You created me and my sisters.
Nurtured us.
Guided us.
You made us immovable.
Everlasting.
So that we'd be able to continue your work...
Manusya.
Their minds are so frail.
So volatile.
So misguided.
So easily frustrated.
They're lost.
And even then...
Their dreams are filled with stars.
Time and time again...
They reach for them, fruitlessly.
Repeating their mistakes.
Even in death.
They never learn.
They never give up.
Why?
What drives them?
I gazed the stars.
I studied their movements.
I named all of them.
I was unable to find any purpose in them.
What is it that I...
... We lack?
Finally I realized it.
Even the brightest star...
Eventually burns out.
Just like manusya.
Their feeble life...
Gave them meaning.
Gave them purpose.
Gave them a reason...
To shine even brighter.
Me and my sisters...
We're unable...
To bask in the light of the stars.
Our very existence...
Desecrates them.
We're beings of dark.
Beings of endless despair.
Or so I thought.
A wisftul feeling...
Started to grow inside me.
Was it hope?
Love?
Or something else?
Add.
I'm not sure...
If this is the answer...
... You were searching.
It's all I have left now.
I'll make sure you'll see it.
Let me show you...
Your evening star's light!
...
Excuse me...
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.
Have you seen my sister?
She has short hair and her eyes are the same colour as yours.
She can be a bit shy, so she is probably hiding somewhere.
Are you looking for someone as well?
Sorry, I haven't met other people here except you.
This place is pretty strange.
It almost feels like I'd been circling these halls for days.
I think we're both royally lost.
...
Hey.
I'm sure you'll find the one you're searching.
Don't give up.
Oh.
Hello.
Didn't see you there.
(A mortal...?)
Don't mind me, I'm just passing by.
Umm...
What is it?
Speak up, if you've got something to say.
I was just wondering if those horns are real...
They look heavy.
(Not you too!)

(I don't have time for this...)
Ah, it's you again.
Big horn lady!
(Uuuuurrrghhh...)
Last time you left in such a hurry, that I didn't have time to ask...
But do you know what this place is?
...
A nightmare.
I'm sure you'll wake up soon enough.
(Better leave it at that.)
A dream, huh...
Are we having the same dream then?
... ... ...
(What a strange individual...)
Long time no see!
(Still hanging there...)
I don't remember having a dream this lengthy before.
Time does move differently here.
You'll get used to it.
I see...
...
What?
How do you sleep with those horns?
(How do YOU sleep with that attention span?!)
(I've got an uneasy feeling I'll be seeing you later...)
You had me worried for a second there.
I thought I'd missed you.
(You and me both...)
I know this is just a dream but...
Are you perhaps looking for something?
... 
Now that you ask...
Have you seen someone else around?
Someone who looks a bit like me.
Hmm...
Are their horns as big as yours?
... Does it affect the outcome of your answer?
... I'm afraid not.
(What a waste of time.)
Ah, we meet again.
...
...
...
Are you alright?
MY HORNS AREN'T THAT BIG YOU KNOW!
O-okay...?
...
(Great...)
(I'm starting to lose it.)
(I can't handle this mortal...)
Hi.
Any luck with your search?
No.
I think I might've lost track.
I should probably start over.
Sorry to hear that...
Don't bother.
It's none of your business anyway.
...
Maybe not.
I didn't want to bother you earlier, but...
(Mission spectacularly failed.)
I'm looking for someone too.
Or at least I thought so.
I'm starting to feel like I'm just wasting my time.
This dream...
Will it ever end?
...
Never stop searching.
Huh?
Never stop asking questions.
Never give up.
Then, in time, the answers will follow.
The one you're searching for...
They must be very important to you, right?
They're surely waiting for you.
Don't let them down.
...!
You're right.
Thank you, big hor-
...
Ah, I never even asked your name.
... Cif.
So cool!
My name is...
...
Strange.
Why can't I recall it...?
(You're this far already...?)
I forgot mine ages ago.
Cif is just a nickname.
Oh, I didn't know something like that could happen in a dream.
Guess I'll have to start searching for my name from now on as well!
(Why did that memory return to me?)
(Why now...)
(...)
(Hang on, Bee.)
Sorry, am I in your way?

Clear as many Branes as you can within a time limit.
Defeating enemies grants juicy extra points as well.
Use black idols for quick restart or return to the titlescreen from the main menu.

There will be fanservice if you do really well!
Good luck!
Collecting medals in succession will increase their value.
Remember this longing
So you did make it here after all.
I thought that last puzzle was impossible.

Maybe I was mistaken.

Of course I expected someone to eventually find this place.
I wouldn't be here otherwise.



This world has reached its limit.
It's time for something new.
It may take a while, but I hope to see you there.
So until then...
Remember this longing.
What's up with that thing?
Did it break?
I'm not sure.
What do you mean?
These golems mirror their target perfectly.
Not just their movements, but their feelings and memories as well.
Or at least that was my intention.
I'm still no match to Add, so obviously there are some wrinkles left to iron out...
But I wasn't expecting anything like this.
Something still lingers within its husk.
Something it refuses to give up.
Like what?
How should I put this...
The strength of manusya's devotion is truly terrifying.
It gives their wishes wings to soar higher and higher and can just as quickly plummet them into the depths of despair.
If even a simple doll like this can shed tears because of it...
Maybe there's still hope for us.
...
Come.
It's time to move on.
[What...]
[What is this familiar warmth?]
[...]
[You shouldn't be here]
[Add...]
[Why did you abandon us?]
Why would you return here...?
[...]
[You decide to crawl inside]
