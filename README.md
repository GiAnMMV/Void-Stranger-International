To make it work, download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/GiAnMMV/Void-Stranger-International/releases/latest). After extracting it, go to the game directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Void Stranger`), paste there the Languages folder and patch `data.win` with `VSTranslator.xdelta` using an xDelta patcher (such as [DeltaPatcher](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/)).
 
To create a new translation into another language, translate the files in [this folder](/Languages/EN) and translate all the strings. After doing that, you'll have one `included.txt` and one `extracted.txt` translated files: create a new folder in `\Languages`, name it the [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) of your language and drop there your translated files. If you have already patched `data.win`, you should be able to select the new language after opening the game.

Also if you want we can add here your translation! We currently support only Latin alphabet languages, but we can add others if there's request.
